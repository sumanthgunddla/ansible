Ansible-----ssh----host1(groupA)
		   host2(groupb)
		   host3(groupc)
-playbook
-inventory
===========================
Ansible we are using configuration management tool 
terrform we are using Iac
puppet and chef ansible all are using configuration management tool

====================
i want to update a patch in server's
i want to update a software in server's
i want to update or install patch and software in 100 miachines
tomcat running in multiple machines i want to restart a tomact service in 20 machines we are using ansible
in configuration file i want to change port number in 20 machines we use ansible.
i want to delete files in 50 machines olerd than 100 dats files.
i want to archive files more than 500 mb in 50 machines.

we have huge infrasture we can go to evry machine install softwares it is time taking problem
============================================================
we have 
push model: ansible push model so ansible is famous
ansible we can call it as agent-less
ansible tool we can install on one machine that machine we can call it as master or contorller machine
controller: whare ansible install that machine we can call it as controller machine
i1,i2,i3---i100---this 100 machines no need to install any software so we can call it as agent less

masteror controller(ansible)-------I1000(worker nodes or managed nodes)----agentless software
=====================================================
idemotante: managed node in desire state ansible doesn't do any changes.
 
i have 2 machines
i1
i2
i want to install apache2 in i1 and i2 machines

but hear i1(Apache2)-present
         i2(apche2())-in present-N/A
	
ansible is trying to install apache2 in i1 and i2
but here i1 allredy install apache2 so ansible does't do any changes in i1 machine
that is process is called idempotence.

i1---is desire state
i2 in---in desire state

mangeed node in desire statge ansible does't do any changes that is called idempotence

ex2: i want to copy f1 into /home/ubuntu in 100 machines
i1---/home/ubuntu/f1-desire stage
i2---N/A
.
.
i100-N/A

i1 having allredy f1 file is there so ansible doen't copy ti i1 machine

that is in desire statge ansible doenot do any changes

ansible
1) push model
2) idompotence
3) agent-less tool


==============================
pull model---chef and puppet are both are pull model

i need to install in worker nodes agent software and
chef(master)-----centralrepo(keep it code what you want to excute in maged nodes)-------i1,i2,----i100.
so we can call it as pull model

chef agent pull the code from chef then agent push the code excute to multiple servers
any proble on installig we dont know 
in future we have 20 machine we need to install on anible agent in all 20 machines

chef (master)----i1,i2,i3    i1 i2 i3 all are pull from chef master and excute their required software
ansible pushed software  to the i1 i2 i3 machies
tha is main diff between push model and pull models

==================================================
how ansible knows what machines are managed nodes s 

we need to give machine ip's to master using inventory files.
inventy file's contains ip adress
on that ip adress ansible runs the scripts.

i excuted cmd's on master that action push on workernodes 

how ansible commnicate to worker nodes 

if linux machines are worker nodes ansible use ssh-connection
we need to estabilish connction between masternode and worker-nodes tha is our responsiblity.
master nodes need to be linux machine's.
master and controller node's both are linux machine's we are using ssh-connection s we need to establish the connections 
================================================================

By default in AWS OS images are designed for password less(.pem/.ppk Key based authentication) authentication
1) we are achivie passwdrd less autication
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
create user that user give sudo permisions
passwdauthication=yes
permitrootlogin=yes
service sshd restart

using of ssh contoller and manged nodes commnicate.
ssh-keygen

---hadoop---commands----
after setup
ansible group1 -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest"
ansible group1 -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

Note:
1. If you execute same  commands above,
 it will skip to execute. Because, those are already running.
 It will skip the execute. This is called as Idempotence. 

2. Ad-hoc commands are the commands, it will executes only one module once. 
To use more modules to use, we will go for playbooks.
3.  Ad-hoc commands in Ansible allow you to execute 
simple tasks at the command line against one or all of your hosts. Examples

adhioc comnad
playbooks invents
replace text
copy index.html to workernodes
install benfits files to worker nodes

ansible variabls
inventory variables
variable precendece variable
group_vars
roles
ansible galaxy
ansible valute
===============================================================
tasks:
1) launch 2 server's
2) install ansible in one server make it as name ansible
3) i2 server add like managed node
for installing ansible python is req but now not required allredy ther in latest server's
for installing ansible find below steps

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

ansible want to commnicate with managed node's
we need to tell to ansible you need to maine those machine's are managed node's
where we want to mention that managed node's ip's in inventory's files 

default inventory file is located /etc/ansible/hosts 

#inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
#library        = /usr/share/my_modules/
#module_utils   = /usr/share/my_module_utils/
#remote_tmp     = ~/.ansible/tmp
#local_tmp      = ~/.ansible/tmp
#plugin_filters_cfg = /etc/ansible/plugin_filters.yml
#forks          = 5
#poll_interval  = 15
#sudo_user      = root
#ask_sudo_pass = True

========================
3) for server we are adding that i2 private ip in inventory file 

inventory file location /etc/ansible/hosts
=======================
all ansible cmd;'s will stat's with ansible 
how can we identified inventory files having ip's

cmd: ansible all --list-hosts

when ever we want to commnicate with machines ansible only commnicate with what is inventoey files that machines only it will comnicate
but how it will work with managed node's we need to establish the ssh connction b/w master andcontroller 
ansible want to commnicate with manged nodes want ssh connection.
==========================
for managed and worker nodes are commnication b/w them
source machine want's private-key-.pem file  and destination machine want's to publikey--.ppk 

what is default name of private key id_rsa 
what is default name of pub key id_rsa.pub

4) create ssh keys pub and private key's 
pub key(kappa) send to destination machie and private key(key) wnat to keep here source machine only 
5) establih the connection b/w master and worker 

10.0.0.261------controller---ubunt user
10.0.0.90-------------ubuntu user---w1
10.0.0.80----ubuntu user---w2
10.0.0.70-----ubuntu user---w3

conn establish b/w con node ubuntu user to worker node ubuntu user

what is establish connection between 2 server's 
ans: nothing but from one machine to excute in cmd's in another machine that means 2 machines are connection established .
we can connect with another machine using private key that 2 machine are in establish connection 
======================

ansible all --list-hosts

1) for ansible master need to connect to conrtoller we have to mention controller ip's in that inventrey files
inventory file loc show above

2) for we cant to establish the conn between master and contoller

3) then for master conn for controller ansible want private key that private key name id_rsa that file present in user home dir/.ssh/id_rsa

ansible all -m ping----pong means it is connected sucessful
we are having multiple modules in asnible
==================
terraform using infrasture management
ansible used for configuration mangement tool & it is work on the infrsture
for i want to delete particular file in all machines then i want to install softwares
terraform working for creating infrasture ansible working on that infrasture

===============================
1) we can done with copy module
task:
1) i want to copy file from ansible master machine to manged nodes

we can do grouping options in ansible other wise we can do all
db
[i1,i2]
web
[13,14]

ansible db -m ping
ansible web -m ping
ansible all(which group server u want to perform) -m(which module you want befor that you can give -m option) ping(module name)-----it is for all groups
================================
ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/passwd dest=/home/ubuntu"
yellow colour came then it is copied sucessful

again run same comman copy module it will not do any changes because manged nodes are desired stage 
it wil give green

that is called idempotence
============
in ansible some command's are overide idempotence feture

ansible copying file from one machine to another machile whi will owner of that file ubuntu only
ansible is commnicate with all machines using ubuntu user 

in contoller i am in ubuntu user using ubuntu user we are not mention any user of managed node's
ansible is thing manged nodes' also having ubuntu user it will copy using ubuntu user only that file
owner is ubuntu only 
===================================
in ansible some command's are break's the idepotance feauteru .
99% do use that type os command's in ansible 
ansible for designed idpotance feauteru 
but some modules are doesn't support idepotance feautere 
==============================
q) i am copying file one machine to antoter machiner using of which user crediant's .
ansible controller copying one machine to another machine using of ubuntu but not ubuntu user not in another managed node
here ansible contoller node using with ubuntu user copying to file controller to managerd node ansible thinking managed node's also having same user that file
owner is ubuntu only .
==================================================
ansible want's  to connect with managed node's  
default inventory file is located /etc/ansible/hosts
in that file maintaine managed node's ip's and grup of ip's 
for all managed nodes connting purpose  that folrd placed in the user home dir /.ssh/private.key in the controller
========================================================
ansible--------connect with ppk file and using ubuntu user login with i1 instance----------------i1(ubuntu)--publkey in ~/.ssh/authozed_keys
~/.ssh/.ppk file--connect with ppk file and using shashi user login with i2 machine---------------------i2(shashi)----publkey in ~/.ssh/authozed_keys


when ever ansible copy file contoller to managed nodes. using of managed user's copyed  file owner managed node user only 
in linux each have a owner 
==========================
ansible is the copied file to managed node's that file who is owner that file which user using login to managed node user that user is the owner that file 

=======================================
ansible  group name(all) -m copy -a "src=/home/a dest=/home/"

 ansible is copiy files into controller using of ubuntu ansible think's thet maaged node's also having same user if dont have that user in managed node's it will 
throws error

 ansible is copiy files into controller i am not mention any thing   ansible think's thet maaged node's also having same user ubuntu 
 if dont have that user in managed node's it will throws error
============================
tasks:

10.0.0.243---ubuntu user using login with this machine
10.0.0.161----sheshi user using login with this machine

what we will do.
 steps1) we want to create 1st sheshi user in managed node's4
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash sheshi
step2 : authorized key's file copy into shahsi user home directory
sudo cp -r ~ubuntu/	.ssh ~sheshi/
sudo chown -R sheshi:shesahi ~shehsi/.ssh

ansible all -m ping 

ansible ping to managed node's using of ubuntu only 
but i want to use connect with 161 server using shahshi user

so go to inventry file mention 161 ip along with sheshi user using of synatx

ansible/hosts
10.0.0.243
10.0.0.161 ansible_user=sheshi

ansible all -m ping

this cmd pin:pong
243--ubuntu
161shehsi user

now i want to copy file 
ubunru:ansible all -m copy -a "src=/ dest=/"
243---file owner ubuntu
161---file owner shehsi

in inventory file after ip you need to mention 
 

root: ansible all -m ping
error: why i am geting this error
in root user home dir not having private key so it's giving error

ansible cmd's excuting with which user

ssh keys all are present in the ubuntu user home directory
not in root user home directory 

where look for private keys
userhomedir/.ssh/id_rsa

sudo ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/passwd dest=/abc"
it will aslo give error why means 
destination not writable
root user excuting this command not on that machine
ubuntu user not having wirte permisions root user
==================================
copy commend opposite to fetch command
fetch: this command using this fetch file from manged node's to controller
all : means all invenroy thing's

sudo ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/passwd" dest=."
i am having 2 machine's managed node's but i copied all managed node's passwd file to contoller 
which passwd file present in the contoller

passwd file from worker node1
passwd file from worker node2
passwd file from worker node3

each inventory it will create a folder
10.0.0.243           10.0.0.161
   /etc/passwd           /etc/passwd


ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/shadow"  dest=."

it will give eoor because ubuntu user not having read  permisons on shadow file 

sudo ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/passwd" dest=."

error because sudo privilizes only working in itself machine


ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/passwd" dest=." -b

sucess
because ansible command excute command with managed node's that user's with root privilizes 
if managed node's having user's have root privilizers it working file
other wise it throws error
233--sucess
161--sheshi user not having root privilzer's
=================================
i want to display list of file in ubuntu directory
some commnd's we should not use requrally 
in remore machine sheshi.sh folder is there i want to excute all worker node's
ansible giving shell module 
using of shell module excute .sh file in remote machine's 
but shell module not follow the idmoptence 

ansible all -m shell -a "ls -l"
ansible all -m shell a "ls -l /tmp"
ansible all -m shell -a "ls -l /tmp > test"===it excute in all worker nodes

shell module break the idepotence 

command module excute the command's
ansible all -m command -a "echo sheshivarhdan > test1"
command module doest follw idempotancd



======================
command module and shell module bioth are excute command's in remote machine 
but what is diff between the command vs shell


ansible all -m command -a "echo sheshivardhan > test1"

command module doesn't follow idmpotance feauter

shell and command module both are excute command in worker node's

ansible all -m command -a "ls -l  /etc |grep ^d |  wc -l"

command module doesn't support shell feautere
shell feauter nothing but: redirection , pipeing,command substution
other command's work work properly but shell feautere doen't work it

in case of shell module it will work with shell feature
|,$HOME,>< etc...
=======================================================

 q): i want to create file in the worker node's /home/ubuntu/abc.txt file

ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ubuntu/abc.txt state=touch"
243---server sucessful
161---server failure why because sheshi user doen't have permision to create file ubuntu directory

again work above command sucessful create abc.txt file with new time stamp
====================
Q) i want to see the particular file is avalable or not

ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ubuntu/abc.txt state=file"

ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ubuntu state=file"
error tht is not a file that is dir
================
q) i want to check the create a dir is avalable or not 
ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ubuntu/abc.txt state=directory"

=======================
q) i want to delete a directory
ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ubuntu/abc.txt state=absent"
1st time excute dir deleted 2nd excute dir not found
=================================================
i want to install apache2 software
ans) 
ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"

this command error  why because when we can install softwares using of sudo privilizers's only
sudo ansible -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"
this one also give error because sud cmd excute within the server

sudo ansible -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" -b 
1st you need to update the server

ansible -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present update_cache=yes" -b
====================
i want to delete softwares 
 
ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=absent"
====================================================

here 127 in web app & db group
ansible 10.0.0.127 -m apt -a "name=tomcat9 state=present" -b
only particular server you want to install software write like that
================================
what is git clone do
clone the repogotory 

git clone
git fetch
git pull

what is diff b/w pull and fetch
======================
i want to see all privte ip'sin vpc
aws ec2 decribe-instances --filters vpc-id | grep
===============================================================
78th-video

we are having  uri module  command 
it will ping that site if that site is there it will give 200 
other wise it will give the 404 error page not found error.

ansible 10.0.0.15 -m uri -a "url=http://google.com"
200: sucess goog.com it is there 
ansible 10.0.0.15 -m uri -a "url=http://smaranit.com/sheshi"

uri just like wget it will ping page is there other wise it will give 404 error.

modules:
uri
apt---to install softwares in ubuntu 
yum---to install softwares linux
===============================
to install softwares

ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"

ansible all -m yum -a "name=apache2 state=present"

firat update then install

ansible all -m yum -a "name=apache2 state=present update_cache=yes"

root user only install softwares so use -b manes become i not mention it will treat as a root

ansible all -m yum -a "name=apache2 state=present update_cache=yes" -b

ansible all -m yum -a "name=apache2 state=absent" -b

ansible all -m yum -a "name=apache2 state=latest" -b 

latest means latest package will be excute 
=======================================================
i want to start the service using of service module 

ansible all -m service -a "name=apache2 state=started" -b 

ansible all -m service -a "name=apache2 state=stopped" -b

yellow means changes
green means desirable state it will not do any thing 
========================================================
i want to copy shell script from controller to manged node after that i want to excute in that managed node's

script nothing but the any code

1st step copy the file into all managed nodes 
2 nd step excute the that script 

instead of this comand's excute manuvally we will write some play book's

in k8s we call as manifest files 
here we can call as play book's
we wrote all comand's in this play book excute that play book's
play book's are written in the yaml .
=================================================
task1: copy file from controller to manged node's

service module excuteing 2nd time and restarting the servuce again
when ever changes done only i want to restart the service 
==========================================`
when ever my configuration file is change's then only my service is restarted
now notify is comes into picture 

when notify command will excute that linefile module do any changes then only it will excute
other wise does't excute. 
when notify module excute then only that related handeler will excute.

=NOTIFY EXCUTE that related module some change's in system that module not change's it will not excute=================================================
handles we can write task section in handelr section we can write task

handelrs excute 1 time all task section will excute then only last handelr's will excute
in task section we are having 10 modules that 10 modules excute then only handerls will excute
that related taskn ot any change's it will not excute.
pysically it will do some chane's in system.
